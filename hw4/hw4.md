## Getting Started

Login to your 15L account either from a lab machine or via `ssh`. From your
home directory, enter the following commands:

```
$ gethw
$ cd ~/homework/hw4
$ vim hw4.md
```

Answer these questions in the `hw4.md` file you now have open.

_Don't forget to change the file header!_

1. Suppose you are testing a function using the JUnit framework, and want to check whether 
some variable `foo` equals 5. What is the one line of code to test this? **(1 point)**

        assertEquals(5,foo);

2. From Lab 4, explain the purpose of our `CLASSES` variable for 
our Makefile. **(1 point)**

        The variable is a list of the classes that will be used in the Makefile (IntegerListInterface.class, IntegerListTester.class, and IntegerList.class). It can be used as a shortcut when we want to use a command on all classes using a single variable (e.g. setting a dependency for all classes by calling $(CLASSES)).

3. From Lab 4, what happens if we type the command `make test` after 
no changes were made to the dependencies? **(1 point)**

        None of the dependencies will be recompiled and `java -cp ./junit.jar:. IntegerListTester` will be executed. This command will test the functions of the IntegerListTester file using the JUnit framework.

4. You are a renowned software developer and you have been hired by an old
British boyband that wants to make a comeback in the industry. They ask you to
make an app to showcase their new music and events. In your implementation, you
have a class for each of the 5 group members, but you find that compiling each  
band memberâ€™s class takes more time than you currently have. Luckily, you  
remember that you learned about Makefiles in your favorite online class! You
decide to create a Makefile to compile your classes to make testing more
efficient. Since Makefiles can have multiple rules, write out the general
structure of a single rule and explain how it should be interpreted.
**(1 point)**

        In a Makefile, a rule is generally made up of a target, some dependencies, and some commands. This is usually in the format:
        target: dependancies
        (tab) commands
        The target is the name of a file or an action. The dependencies are the input files used within the target. The commands are instructions which will be executed by a shell and must always be written after a tab.

5. The lead singer, Harry Styles, wants to see his name printed every time his
rule is run. Write out the action that will print the phrase `Harry Styles` to the
terminal. **(1 point)**

        echo "Harry Styles"

6. Harry Styles insists that his rule is run by default whenever `make` is called.  
When you run `make` with no arguments, which rule is used by default?
**(1 points)**

        The first rule, which does not start with '.', is used by default.

7. Your Makefile contains a rule named `rocks`. What line do you need to add to
your Makefile to ensure it is run every time `make rocks` is called, even if
`rocks` is a file that exists in the current directory? **(1 points)**

                By adding `.PHONY: rocks` before the `make rocks` command is called, the command will run even if there is a file with the same name in the current directory.

8. To help keep up with the endless demands, you create the following structure.
Explain what the following lines do in a Makefile:  **(1 point)**

    ```Makefile
    .SUFFIXES: .java .class
    .java.class:
        javac $<
    ```

    The two lines tell the relation between .java and .class files. It says that in order to make a .class file, javac needs to be run on the corresponding .java file.

9. Makefile Practice: Tired with the old boys, you settle down to relive simpler
times, but make some errors in your Makefile. Can you fix them? See the Makefile 
in your `~/homework/hw4` directory for details **(6 points)**

## Turnin Procedure:
Be sure your `hw4.md` file is saved on your 15L  account in the directory
`~/homework/hw4`. When logged into your 15L account, enter the following
commands:
```
$ cd ~/homework/hw4
$ turnin15L
```
